	<h3>Item Sponsorships</h3>
	<p>As always we're accepting donations for our big giveaway! To make your prize stand out, we reccommend that it be a somewhat bigger ticket item(s).</p>

	<p>In addtion to the giveaway, we're also accepting donations for door prizes and for contest prizes. Door prizes should be small and, ideally, in larger quantities. Contest prizes will be awarded to winners of our contests, such as our strongfinger contest. Other contests are TBD.</p>
