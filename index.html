      <p>We met with local keyboard nerds at our meetups. We taught soldering and programming in our workshops. <br/>Our goal was to nurture a positive and inclusive community for all ages.</p>

      <h2>We brought keyboard <br/>people together.</h2>
      <p>And we brought people together through keyboards. We were always excited to welcome new people to our meetups and workshops, whether it was their first time touching a mechanical keyboard or they'd been clicking and clacking for years.</p>

      <h2>Did we mention that we <br/>adored mechanical keyboards?</h2>
      <p>The aesthetics, the science, and the mechanical keyboard community always made us feel warm and fuzzy. Dreaming up new and better input devices kept us up at night. We wanted to share our passion with everyone.</p>

      <h2>There was something in this <br />hobby for everyone.</h2>
      <p>People came for the community and the learning; and stayed for the keyboards. Some people even used it as a gateway into other maker/electrical engineering projects. The keyboard world and beyond was theirs for the taking.</p>

      <h2>Our Past Initiatives</h2>
      <p>The world of mechanical keyboards can feel daunting. We were proud to help people on their journey. <br/>We were an organization of volunteers that wanted to share our experience and knowledge with <br/>all of the Pacific Northwest and beyond.</p>

    <ul class="features">
      <li class="icon fa-flag-o">
          <h3>Meetups</h3>
          <p>We brought hundreds of mechanical keyboard enthusiasts together for show-and-tell events in the Seattle area. New friendships were made and new key switches were discovered.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-keyboard-o">
          <h3>Workshops</h3>
          <p>We guided people through the process of soldering and building their own keyboards. We also helped newcomers to programmable boards get started with coding.</p>

      <li class="icon fa-recycle">
        <h3>Restoration</h3>
        <p>Our volunteers restored and modernized old keyboards, which were then donated to good causes.</p>

      <li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
          <h3>Community Support</h3>
          <p>We were always open to new ideas and suggestions on how we could transfer knowledge and keyboard smiles further and wider.</p>
