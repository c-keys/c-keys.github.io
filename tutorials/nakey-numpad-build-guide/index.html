<h2>naKey what?</h2>

<p>Pronounced nah-key. This keyboard is best enjoyed raw without a case. Designed for its PCB aesthetic and its ability to more easily introduce the components on a printed circuit board. The only surface mounted part is the Atmega32u4 (if you take one of our workshops, this chip will come pre-soldered). All other components are through-hole. We chose to do this for aesthetics (through-hole so pretty), beginner-friendly soldering, and easier component identification.</p>
