<p>As Jack and Skullydazed continue to blur the lines between computer keyboards and musical keyboards, we thought it would be fun to host a little musical contest for the meetup! We understand that not everyone can <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/796uan/planck_music_hits_vol_1/>cover The Final Countdown on their Planck</a>, so we are opening this up to any sounds made by a keyboard!</a></p>

<p>Have some switches that click just perfectly? Let’s hear em!<br>
Finally got the thocc just right on your lubed hypersphered HHKB? Bring it out!<br>
Have an original composition to play via MIDI? Works for us!<br>
Managed to rig up your Clueboard 60 to act as a USB audio device to play music from your computer? You’d be the winner in our eyes, but we aren't the ones judging!</p>

<p>Who is judging, you ask? None other than Jack and Skullydazed themselves! They’ve been really supportive of our meetups over the last two years, so we really wanted to make this contest about them. Skullydazed will be around in person to listen in, and Jack will be telepresence’d in somehow, much like the January meetup. Come wow them and take home something cool!</p>
