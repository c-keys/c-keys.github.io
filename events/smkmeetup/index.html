<h2>Get ready for the 4th semi-annual <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23smkmeetup&src=typd">#smkmeetup</a></h2>
  <p>Expect keyboards in all shapes and sizes. If you're looking to try out something new, it is likely to be at this event. So come early and stay until close because there will be plenty of people to meet and plenty of keyboards to see.</p>

  <p>We're doing things a little different this time. We need to limit the number of attendees with keyboards to the first 125 RSVPers. We learned at our summer meetup that 225 people with 300+ keyboards crammed us in tight at the LCM+L. We love the museum and are commited to holding our smaller and more intimate meetups there every winter. But don't worry, we are planning to go big this summer!</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that RSVPers are serious about showing up to the event, we are asking for a minimum donation of $15 for your RSVP ticket. In exchange, you will receive a door prize (more on this coming soon). All proceeds will go directly towards scholarships/subsidizing costs of cKeys' youth and adult workshops.</p>

  <p>When you're ready to signup, click the RSVP button below.</p>
