<h4>5:00PM - Closing time</h4>
<p>
  Time to take the celebration somewhere else in Seattle. Keep your ears open
  for unofficial after-meetup dinners and gatherings.

<h3>Sunday's Workshops</h3>

<p><em>
  This is the first year we are offering workshops on the day after the meetup. This way no one has to miss their precious meetup festivities in order to build keyboards and/or learn how to solder. <strong>NOTE: These workshops are at a different venue on SUNDAY: <a href="https://www.livingcomputers.org">Living Computers Museum + Labs</a></strong></em>
</p>

<h4>4x5 keyboard soldering workshop</h4>
<p><strong><em>Sunday from 11am-1:30pm</em></strong>
<div class="box alt">
  <div class="row uniform 50%">
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"
        ><img src="/images/4x4-proton-c-2.jpg" alt=""
      /></span>
    </div>
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"
        ><img src="/images/4x4-proton-c-1.jpg" alt=""
      /></span>
    </div>
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"
        ><img src="/images/4x4-proton-c-3.jpg" alt=""
      /></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The images above are outdated. We're upgrading the original 4x4 keyboard workshop to a 4x5 keyboard with rotary encoder and other goodies. Includes Proton C, Kailh box switches, grab bag keycaps, rotary encoder, PCB case, and other components. But don't wait for the updated photos because there are only a few seats left. Get them while you can!</p>

<h4>Soldering Basics</h4>
<p><strong><em>Sunday from 2:15pm-4:45pm</em></strong>
<div class="box alt">
  <div class="row uniform 50%">
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"><img src="/images/soldering-basics-workshop-1.jpg" alt=""/></span>
    </div>
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"><img src="/images/soldering-basics-workshop-2.jpg" alt=""/></span>
    </div>
    <div class="4u">
      <span class="image fit"><img src="/images/soldering-basics-workshop-3.jpg" alt=""/></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We just added this $16 soldering basics workshop to the lineup so we have a lot of extra seats to fill! We're taking what we have learned from teaching more advanced workshops and focusing on the basics. You will leave with a LED and mechanical switch blinky fidgety thingy. You will also leave this workshop confident in your soldering skills!</p>

<p>
