  <h3>Keyboard Talks</h3>

  <p>We're trying something new this summer: pre-meetup keyboard presentations from world renowned community members. Plan to arrive by 11:00am if you want to catch the talks and Q&amp;A. If you can't attend early, we also plan to record and stream each talk. <strong>Note: keyboards cannot be set up nor displayed until after the talks and no sooner than 1:30pm.</strong></p>

  <h3>Photobooth</h3>

  <p>Get your spacebar mustaches ready. We're not exactly sure what kind of photos you will take with your keyboards; let the experimentation begin!</p>

    <h3>LCM Loan Forms</h3>
    <p>Yes, everyone will need keyboard loan forms again but it should be easier this time!</p>
  </header>
  <p>We are going to attempt to automate the process of filling out the forms. When you RSVP to the event, you are also agreeing to the terms of the Living Computer Museums loan form. Watch for any email updates from us regarding the loan forms because you may need to take further action (but hopefully the RSVP form will be all that is required).</p>
  <p>These requirements are at the request of Living Computers given their liability responsibilities as a non-profit museum. Please be respectful; <strong>friends don't let friends bring keyboards into the museum without proper documentation.</strong></p>
