<h2>Get ready for another <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23smkmeetup&src=typd">#smkmeetup</a></h2>
  <p>We couldn't resist hosting another winter meetup (even though we told you we weren't going to). However, this one will be old school. Just a casual event where everyone can check out each others keyboards. No giveaways, no contests, and no photo booth. But we don't need any of those things to enjoy each other's company and keyboards. Join us for a low-key event at a freaking amazing location.</p>

  <p>RSVP tickets are free. And as long as you RSVP *and bring at least one keyboard*, then you will get into the museum for free. However, if you RSVP, and come without a keyboard, you will need to pay the museum admission fee. You get in for free because we are the exhibit showcasing our keyboards to the public.</p>

  <p>There won't be any t-shirts for this meetup. But, right now, we are running a <a href="/tshirts">separate t-shirt fundraiser</a> (through December 2nd, 2018). This is your chance to get t-shirts from previous events. We added a local meetup pickup option too if you aren't in a rush to get your t-shirts.</p>

  <p><sup>* If you RSVP and bring a keyboard, the museum will admit you for free because you are an "exhibitor" of keyboards at the museum for the day. This event is public, so anyone can attend without an RSVP. But without an RSVP and keyboard, museum entry fee or museum membership will be required.</sup></p>
