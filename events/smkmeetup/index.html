<h2>
  Get ready for the 8th semi-annual

</h2>
<p>
  Join us for a casual day in a keyboard petting zoo. There will be hundreds of keyboards to type on and talk about. Come for the keyboards; stay for the community.
</p>

<p>
We will also have keyboard soldering workshops! More details coming soon (if you RSVP, we will email you once workshop registration is available).
</p>

<p>
Bring your own mechanical keyboard(s) and receive free admission to the Living Computers Museum + Labs. The museum generously provides the space for everyone to meetup, share, and socialize over keyboards. In exchange, we provide the museum with a quasi-pop-up keyboard exhibit. If you don't have a keyboard to show off in the petting zoo, you will need to pay admission once you arrive at the museum (the museum is totally worth it).

    because you are an "exhibitor" of keyboards at the museum for the day. This
