<h2>Build your own handwired keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>Take home your own custom handwired keyboard!</strong></p>

<p>Handwire? If you've never tried it, this is the workshop for you! Whether you've only soldered with PCBs or have never soldered at all, you will walk away with tips and tricks to help you with your next keyboard project. Handwiring switches and diodes to a microntroller is a good skill to have for both prototyping and one-off projects.</p>

<p>Have you seen handwired projects online and thought you could never do it yourself? Learn handwiring first hand from someone that thinks handwiring is *easier* than working with PCBs.</p>

<p>You will learn the basics of keyboard electronics, microcontrollers, and soldering. Leave the workshop with your own 4x4 programmable USB keyboard. Your microcontroller will come pre-flashed. After the workshop you can learn how to program and flash your fully programmable keyboard yourself (or attend one of our not-yet-announced workshops on keyboard firmware). We will provide all tools and supplies.</p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3>

<p>Handwiring skills for prototyping and one-off project with keyboards and beyond.</p>
<p>If you don't already know how to solder, you will learn. If you already know how to solder, we will help you improve your technique.</p>
<p>Our teacher to attendee ratio will be at least 1 to 4, so there will be ample time to answer any questions that may arise throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>You will leave with the confidence to build keyboards at home. You will also be introduced to our attendee chat where you can ask questions and learn from other attendees longterm.</p>
