title: Handwire Soldering Workshop

<h2>Build your own handwired keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>Now with the new Proton C ARM based microcontroller!</strong></p>

<p>Handwire (a.k.a point-to-point)? If you haven't tried it, this is the workshop for you! Whether you have only soldered with PCBs or have never soldered at all, you will walk away with tips and tricks to help you with your next keyboard project. Handwiring switches and diodes to a microntroller (Proton C) is a good skill to have for both prototyping and one-off projects.</p>

<p>You will learn the basics of keyboard electronics, microcontrollers, and soldering. Leave the workshop with your own 4x4 programmable USB keyboard. Your microcontroller will come pre-flashed. After the workshop you can learn how to program and flash your fully programmable keyboard yourself (or attend one of our not-yet-announced workshops on keyboard firmware). We will provide all tools and supplies.</p>
