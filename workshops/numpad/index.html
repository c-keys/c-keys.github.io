<h2>Build your own through-hole numpad</h2>
<p><strong>Take home your own programmable numpad keyboard!</strong></p>

<p>This isn't just a programmable numpad keyboard. Building this numpad will teach you about basic PCB design and layout. Have you ever wondered what all of the tiny components are on a keyboard PCB?</p>
<p>As you solder the through-hole components on this PCB, you will learn what each component does and why it is on the PCB. All components are through-hole components except for the ATMEGA32u4 (the ATMEGA32u4 will come pre-soldered for your convenience). Leave with a pre-flashed programmable keyboard.</p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3>

<p>You will learn the basics of keyboard electronics, PCBs, and soldering.</p>
<p>If you don't already know how to solder, you will learn. If you already know how to solder, we will help you improve your technique.</p>
<p>Our teacher to attendee ratio will be at least 1 to 4, so there will be ample time to answer any questions that may arise throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>You will leave with the confidence to build keyboards at home. You will also be introduced to our attendee chat where you can ask questions and learn from other attendees longterm.</p>
