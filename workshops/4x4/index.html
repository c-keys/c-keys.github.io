---
<h2>Build your own 4x4 keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>Take home your own custom keyboard!</strong></p>

<p>Learn the basics of keyboard electronics, microcontrollers, and soldering. Leave the workshop with your own 4x4 USB keyboard. Before you go, we will also flash your keyboard with your choice of a num pad, emoji keyboard (Linux and Windows only), or midi controller. After the workshop you can learn how to program and flash your fully programmable keyboard yourself (or attend one of our not-yet-announced workshops on keyboard firmware). We will provide all tools and supplies.</p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3>

<p>If you don't already know how to solder, you will learn. If you already know how to solder, we will help you improve your technique.</p>
<p>Our teacher to attendee ratio will be at least 3 to 1, so there will be ample time to answer any questions that may arise throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>You will leave with the confidence to build keyboards at home. You will also be introduced to our attendee chat where you can ask questions and learn from other attendees longterm.</p>
