<h2>Build your own 4x4 keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>Now with the new Proton C ARM based microcontroller!</strong></p>

<p>Learn the basics of keyboard electronics, microcontrollers, and soldering. Leave the workshop with your own 4x4 USB keyboard. Your microcontrollr will come pre-flashed with a working QMK layout. After the workshop you can learn how to program and flash your fully programmable keyboard yourself (or attend one of our not-yet-announced workshops on keyboard firmware). We will provide all tools and supplies.</p>
