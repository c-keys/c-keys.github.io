<h2>Build your own MIDI controller!</h2>
<p><strong>Now with the new Proton C ARM based microcontroller!</strong></p>

<p>Would you like to make digital sound and music with (almost) anything? This is your chance to build a midi controller that will allow you to solder or alligator clip wires to real world objects of your choosing. Our kit is heavily inspired by Makey Makey but with a built in piezo speaker (for that chiptune vibe), a midi first focus, and programmability via QMK.</p>

<p>In this workshop you will solder our MIDI Any controller which includes a PCB, a Proton C microcontroller, and alligator clip wires. This is workshop is suitable for all soldering skill levels.</p>
